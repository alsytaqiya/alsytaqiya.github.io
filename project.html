								  <h2>Thesis Project</h2>
									  <p>Built with Moodle platform, this thesis project resulted in a product of an Electronic Module (E-module) in the shape of a Learning Management System (LMS) for project-based learning on user interface and user experience, based on the Merdeka Curriculum (the new education curriculum in Indonesia) that can be accessed on the SIBELA e-learning website. The developed E-module serves as a learning resource for students majoring in Software Engineering in grades X and XI at SMK Negeri 4 Malang. This Learning Management System E-module is titled Freelance UI/UX 101: From Concept to Delivery, involving knowledge and strategies to become a freelance UI/UX designer. The learning materials on user interface and user experience include concepts such as basic UX concepts, project brief, UX research with design thinking framework, moodboard, wireframe, basic elements and principles of visual design, mockup, prototyping, testing, and personal branding as a UX designer. These learning materials follow a project-based learning concept with instructions provided for each step of the material, leading to a final design project.<br></p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/Thesis Mockup.png" alt="" /></span><b> Here are the detailed steps in the lessons development of the electronic module:</b>
									<ol>
										<li><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">Basic UX Concepts, covering various basic UX materials such as introduction to UX design, characteristics of quality UX design, types of UX designer careers, and introduction to the Design Thinking approach.</span></li>
										<li>Project Brief, containing explanations of real example design project guidelines as if given by a client to a designer. The author explains the contents and meanings of the parts of the project brief, which are then used in the design project guidelines for the Globilingo website by students.</li>
										<li>UX Research with Design Thinking Framework, covering the steps in the design thinking approach. The author explains the steps that UX designers need to take before designing UX design. These steps include empathizing, defining, and ideating, and applying them to the practice of designing the Globilingo website.</li>
										<li>Moodboard, emphasizing the importance of seeking design inspiration from expert designers so that participants can apply the ATM method (Observe, Imitate, and Modify).</li>
										<li>Wireframe, which is an outline framework of an application or website design to identify layout arrangement, information architecture, flow of an application, functionality, and user behavior desired. Wireframing is the activity of creating wireframes. With wireframes, a UI designer can more easily design a mockup and this can also serve as a means of communication with stakeholders to approve information placement.</li>
										<li>Basic Elements and Principles of Visual Design in Mockups, which are things to consider in creating a visual design, including a user interface design. These basic elements and principles of visual design are applied so that a product looks attractive, adheres to visual design principles, and facilitates users in using the product. The basic elements in visual design in this E-module include discussions of color, iconography, and typography. While the basic principles of visual design to be discussed include emphasis, hierarchy, proportion, unity, and variety.</li>
										<li>Mockup, which is a concept deeper than wireframe, containing various aspects of visual design, such as coloring in the user interface design, use of typography, and inclusion of images with more detailed views.</li>

													<p>The project, running from April 14th to May 11th, 2022, addresses common issues in existing English language apps, such as lackluster UI designs, limited question variety, and uninspiring user interactions. The goal is to assist users in exam preparation and improve their English learning journey. As the UI/UX designer, the responsibilities included extensive research, user flow development, wireframing, mockup designing, prototyping, and testing. The research method involved engaging users via WhatsApp to understand their expectations and concerns regarding English exam apps. Findings indicated users' dissatisfaction with UI designs, lack of interactive features, limited question variety, and absence of engaging interactions.</p></b>
														<p>A user persona, Rosalina Wijayanti, highlighted the need for varied questions, error-free content, and engaging features. The competitive analysis revealed shortcomings in menu visibility and multilingual support among rivals. The goal was to offer an enjoyable, educational experience for English learners through a user-friendly interface. The high-fidelity prototype aimed to provide accessible practice materials, engaging English speaking practice, and accurate proficiency assessment.</p>
